# Food Web Analyzer

## Overview

Welcome to the Food Web Analyzer! This Java application is designed to analyze a food web represented in a file and extract valuable information about the relationships between organisms. The application identifies predators, prey, apex predators, producers, most flexible eaters, and even the tastiest organisms in the given food web.

## Features

- **File Input**: The application reads a file containing the representation of a food web. The file should contain information about the relationships between organisms.

- **Adjacency Map Graph**: The relationships between organisms are represented using an adjacency map graph data structure. This allows efficient traversal and analysis of the food web.

- **Identification of Organisms**:
  - **Predators and Prey**: The application identifies organisms that act as predators and prey in the food web.
  - **Apex Predators**: Apex predators, at the top of the food chain, are identified.
  - **Producers**: Organisms that produce food through photosynthesis or other means are recognized.
  - **Most Flexible Eaters**: The application identifies organisms that have a broad diet and can adapt to different food sources.
  - **Tastiest Organisms**: The tastiest organisms, based on certain criteria, are highlighted.
